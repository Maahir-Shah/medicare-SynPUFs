Analysis of a synthetically generated sample of Medicare claims data (Medicare SynPUFs)

Medicare claims data is a complex dataset that includes a breadth of information. The use of interactive dashboards assists in the exploratory analysis of such complex data as it allows one to drill dow and filter information to tackle specific questions, and view data from different perspectives. This enables an individual/enterprise to make effective data-driven decisions based on complex data.

I have developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze sample data of beneficiaries of the synthetic Medicare claims data, for the year 2008. This preliminary dashboard allows one to understand and visualize characteristics of the population of beneficiaries in the sample claims data, be it for a particular state or race of individuals.

You can access and interact with the dashboard via Tableau Public, through this link [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/MedicareDeSynPUFs/2008BeneficiaryDashboard?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
